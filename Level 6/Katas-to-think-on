*** Sort the Odd ***

You will be given an array of numbers. You have to sort the odd numbers in ascending order while leaving the even numbers at their original positions.
Examples

[7, 1]  =>  [1, 7]
[5, 8, 6, 3, 4]  =>  [3, 8, 6, 5, 4]
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]  =>  [1, 8, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 9, 0]

*** Prime Factorization *** 

The prime factorization of a positive integer is a list of the integer's prime factors, together with their multiplicities; the process of determining these factors is called integer factorization. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic says that every positive integer has a single unique prime factorization.

The prime factorization of 24, for instance, is (2^3) * (3^1).

Write a class called PrimeFactorizer whose constructor accepts exactly 1 number (a positive integer) and has a property factor containing an object where the keys are prime numbers as strings and the values are the multiplicities.

new PrimeFactorizer(24).factor //should return { '2': 3, '3': 1 }


*** Take a number and sum its digits raised tot hte consecutive powers ***

The number 898989 is the first integer with more than one digit that fulfills the property partially introduced in the title of this kata. What's the use of saying "Eureka"? Because this sum gives the same number: 89=81+9289 = 8^1 + 9^289=81+92

The next number in having this property is 135135135:

See this property again: 135=11+32+53135 = 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3135=11+32+53
Task

We need a function to collect these numbers, that may receive two integers aaa, bbb that defines the range [a,b][a, b][a,b] (inclusive) and outputs a list of the sorted numbers in the range that fulfills the property described above.
Examples

Let's see some cases (input -> output):

1, 10  --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
1, 100 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 89]

If there are no numbers of this kind in the range [a,b][a, b][a,b] the function should output an empty list.

90, 100 --> []

Enjoy it!!
